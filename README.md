## Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures Using Python
*Bradley N. Miller, David L. Ranum*

This repository contains my solutions to the problems that I have worked through in the [online book](https://runestone.academy/runestone/static/pythonds/index.html).

#### Infinite Monkey Theorem
My solution: [*monkey.py*](monkey.py)

The infinite monkey theorem states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type a given text, such as the complete works of William Shakespeare. Well, suppose we replace a monkey with a Python function. How long do you think it would take for a Python function to generate just one sentence of Shakespeare? The sentence we’ll shoot for is: “methinks it is like a weasel.”

This is my attempt at repeatedly generating random strings until one matches the target string. 

#### Fraction Class
My solution: [*fraction.py*](fraction.py)

My attempt to build a class for a fractional number. 

#### min_number
