## Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures Using Python
*Bradley N. Miller, David L. Ranum*

This repository contains my solutions to the problems that I have worked through in the [online book](https://runestone.academy/runestone/static/pythonds/index.html).

### Infinite Monkey Theorem
My solution: [*monkey.py*](monkey.py)

The infinite monkey theorem states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type a given text, such as the complete works of William Shakespeare. Well, suppose we replace a monkey with a Python function. How long do you think it would take for a Python function to generate just one sentence of Shakespeare? The sentence we’ll shoot for is: “methinks it is like a weasel.”

This is my attempt at repeatedly generating random strings until one matches the target string. 
  
  
### Fraction Class
My solution: [*fraction.py*](fraction.py)

My attempt to build a class for a fractional number. 
  
  
### min_number
My solution: [*min_number.py*](min_number.py)

This code demonstrates two ways to find the minimum number in a given list. The first function is time complexity O(n)^2. The second is O(n). I have integrated matplotlib.pyplot to visualize the function runtimes.
  
  
### visualizing_recursion
My solution: [*visualizing_recursion.py*](visualizing_recursion.py)

This code demonstrates a colorful fractal tree generator. The tree is generated using a recursive process.
  
  
### hashing
My Solution: [*hashing.py*](hashing.py)

This code demonstrates various hash functions used for mapping list items to indices.
  
  
### searching and sorting
My Solution: [*searching_and_sorting.py*](searching_and_sorting.py)

This code demonstrates various searching and sorting methods.
